Our team is building a TableTop RPG scheduling app that assists playgroups with
logistical challenges.  Our app would allow hosts to easily keep track of 
the multitude of scheduling responsibilities; including: meeting times, player 
availability, meeing locations, food responsibilities, and carpooling.  Players 
will be able to upload their availability which will be seen by the host and 
the host can then propose a schedule that will be accepted by the players who 
are available to participate.

Our app will also include some more specific features available to hosts.  
Many TTRPG apps will include features related to the game itself; including: 
dice rolling, storing enemy stats, encouters, and player statsheets.  Our app
will focus more on non-gameplay related functionalities.  Hosts will be able 
to store comprehensive notes about previous sessions, and will be able to 
recall these notes easily; allowing for the host to provide a more coherent
and consistent experience.
